# Docker install

This folder contains a script used by the dockerfile that builds this entire project. It does not play any role during the basic installation procedure detailed in the main `README.md`.

It is especially useful to work with the [FIT/CorteXlab radio testbed](http://www.cortexlab.fr/), see [tutorials](https://wiki.cortexlab.fr/doku.php?id=gnu_radio_docker_benchmark_example).
